But I got an incomplete question :( 

[[Day 4][Hard] High Rise]("https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/code-22-1/challenges/day-4hard-high-rise")

In a 7x7 grid, we want to place buildings in each square given some clues.

Below are some requirements to solving the 7x7 puzzle.
- The height of a building is between 1 and 7
- No two buildings in a row or a column may have the same number of floors
- Taller buldings block the view of shorter buildings located behind them

The input, clues is a 1-dimensional array of 28 integers.

Test Case 1: [3, 1, 5, 5, 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 2]  
Test Case 2: [6, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3]  
Answer to Test Case 2: [[2, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 5],   
                       [3, 2, 5, 7, 4, 6, 1],   
                       [4, 6, 7, 5, 1, 2, 3],   
                       [1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4],   
                       [5, 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6],   
                       [6, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 7],   
                       [7, 5, 4, 1, 6, 3, 2]]
